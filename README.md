# Terraform Provider for Cisco CML2

This repository implements a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) provider for Cisco Modeling Labs version 2.3 and later. It's current state is "beta". Changes can be expected, for example:

- configuration (provider, resources, data-sources)
- provider behavior
- features (additional resources, ...)

> **Note:** While it should work with 2.3, it has only been tested with 2.4 at the moment.  If there's an issue with 2.3 then please open an issue on Github, providing details.  Older versions are blocked within by the `gocmlclient`.

The current implementation provides:

- Resources and a data sources (`internal/provider/`),
  - resource `cml2_lab` to create, update and destroy labs
  - resource `cml2_node` to create, update and destroy nodes in a lab
  - resource `cml2_link` to create, update and destroy links between nodes in a lab
  - resource `cml2_lifecycle` to control the state of a lab (like `STARTED`, `STOPPED`), including staged starting and configuration injection
  - data source `cml2_lab` to retrieve state of an existing lab
  - data source `cml2_node` to retrieve state of an existing node in a lab
- Examples (`examples/`) and generated documentation (`docs/`),
- Miscellaneous meta files.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.0
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.18
- [CML2](https://cisco.com/go/cml) >= 2.3.0

## Building The Provider

1. Clone the repository
1. Enter the repository directory
1. Build the provider using the Go `install` command:

```shell
go install
```

## Using the provider

Please refer to the `examples` directory and look at the built-in documentation
provided via the registry.

### HCL

For some basic examples look in the `examples` directory

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need
[Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see
[Requirements](#requirements) above).

To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put
the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To generate or update documentation, run `go generate`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`. For this
to work, the provider needs to be configured via environment variables.  Here's
an example:

```shell
# for testing purposes, suggest to use direnv

TF_VAR_username="admin"
TF_VAR_password="secret"
TF_VAR_address="https://cml-controller.cml.lab"

export TF_VAR_username TF_VAR_password TF_VAR_address
```

Those are referenced for testing in `internal/provider/testing`.

```shell
make testacc
```

Acceptance testing with Github actions can be achieved using the provided
`tunnel.sh` script which uses tools like `gh` CLI and `ngrok` to forward the API
calls to a locally installed CML instance.  See `tunnel.sh` and the `ghsecret`
[README](cmd/ghsecret/README.md) for additional details
