# cml2_images (Data Source)

A data source that retrieves image definitions from the controller. The optional `node_definition` ID can be provided to filter the list of image definitions for the specified node definition. If no node definition ID is provided, the complete image definition list known to the controller is returned.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "cml2_images" "test" {
  # filter images for the Alpine node definition
  node_definition = "alpine"
}

locals {
  il = data.cml2_images.test.image_list
}

# this returns the image ID of the oldest image for the Alpine node definition
# (last in list...)
output "oldest_alpine" {
  value = element(local.il, length(local.il) - 1).id
}

# the first element of the list has the newest image (alphabetically sorted by
# the image ID)
output "newest_alpine" {
  value = element(data.cml2_images.test.image_list, 0).id
}
```
