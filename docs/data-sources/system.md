# cml2_system (Data Source)

A data source that retrieves system state information from the controller. If a `timeout` is set then this will only return when the system responds.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# ensure the system is ready to talk to by using this data source
# with a timeout like 5m (5 minutes)

data "cml2_system" "wait_for_ready" {
  timeout = "5m"
}
output "readiness" {
  value = data.cml2_system.wait_for_ready.version
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `ignore_errors` (Boolean) If set to `true`, then errors will be ignored during the ready check. This can help when using proxies which might return intermediate errors especially during the initial phase where gateway timeouts or proxy errors might be returned because of initial connectivity issues towards the CML2 instance. Will default to `false`.
- `ready` (Boolean) Shows if the CML system API is ready.
- `timeout` (String) Wait timeout, like `5m`, defaults to 0.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) A UUID. The presence of the ID attribute is mandated by the framework. The attribute is a random UUID and has no actual significance.
- `version` (String) The system software version.
