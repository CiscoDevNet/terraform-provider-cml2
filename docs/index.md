# cml2 Provider

The CML2 Terraform provider helps to
deploy and run entire "virtual networks as code" into the Cisco Modeling Labs network
simulation platform. Available deployment methods allow to create networks (e.g.,
routers, switches and endpoints and their connectivity) as well as import existing CML2
topologies. It also includes fine-grained lifecycle control (staged start up),
configuration injection, IP address retrieval from network devices, and more.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "cml2" {
  # for use of variables, see
  # https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables

  # address must use https://
  address = var.address

  # credentials, either a JWT or username/password are required
  # an error is raised if neither token or username / password are set
  # Note: Using a token is a lot faster than using username and password

  # token   = var.token
  username = var.username
  password = var.password

  # read the CA certificate from file
  # if not specified, the system root CAs are used
  # cacert = file("ca.pem")

  # should the server certificate be verified?
  # (defaults to false, it will be verified)
  # skip_verify = true

  # this configuration option is deprecated with 0.8.0
  # use_cache = false

  # dynamic_config allows to initiate a provider with an incomplete config. For
  # example, the address/URL might only be known later, coming from another
  # module. This is being used in cloud-cml where Terraform provisions a CML VM
  # in the cloud and uses the result of that provisioning process to configure
  # the CML Terraform provider to talk to that instance.
  dynamic_config = false

  # named configs was introduced w/ 0.8.0 and CML 2.7.0, the default is false
  # enable this to provide multiple day0 configurations, the Cat 9000v is a
  # device that supports this to provide a unique serial number per device.
  named_configs = false
}

## Schema

### Required

- `address` (String) CML2 controller address, must start with `https://`.

### Optional

- `cacert` (String) A CA CERT, PEM encoded. When provided, the controller cert will be checked against it.  Otherwise, the system trust anchors will be used.
- `dynamic_config` (Boolean) Does late binding of the provider configuration. If set to `true` then provider configuration errors will only be caught when resources and data sources are actually created/read. Defaults to `false`
- `named_configs` (Boolean) Enables the use of named configs (CML version >2.7.0 required!)
- `password` (String, Sensitive) CML2 password.
- `skip_verify` (Boolean) Disables TLS certificate verification (default is false -- will not skip / it will verify the certificate!)
- `token` (String, Sensitive) CML2 API token (JWT).
- `use_cache` (Boolean, Deprecated) Enables the client cache, **Deprecated**
- `username` (String) CML2 username.
