# cml2_node (Resource)

A node resource represents a CML node. At create time, the lab ID and a node definition must be provided.  Other attributes are optional.  Note that some attributes can't be changed after the node state has changed to `STARTED` (see the lifecyle resource) once and then requires a replace.
