# cml2_node (Resource)

A node resource represents a CML node. At create time, the lab ID, a node definition and a label must be provided.  Other attributes are optional.  Note that some attributes can't be changed after the node state has changed to `STARTED` (see the lifecyle resource) once. Changing attributes will then require a replace.

## Schema

### Required

- `lab_id` (String) Lab ID containing the node (UUID).
- `label` (String) Node label.
- `nodedefinition` (String) Node definition / type. This can only be set at create time.

### Optional

- `boot_disk_size` (Number) Size of boot disk volume, in GB. Can be changed until the node is started once. Will require a replace in that case.
- `configuration` (String) Node configuration. Can be changed until the node is started once. Will require a replace in that case.
- `cpu_limit` (Number) CPU limit in %, 20-100. Can be changed until the node is started once. Will require a replace in that case.
- `cpus` (Number) Number of CPUs. Can be changed until the node is started once. Will require a replace in that case.
- `data_volume` (Number) Size of data volume, in GB. Can be changed until the node is started once. Will require a replace in that case.
- `imagedefinition` (String) Image definition, must match the node type. Can be changed until the node is started once. Will require a replace in that case.
- `ram` (Number) Amount of RAM, megabytes. Can be changed until the node is started once. Will require a replace in that case.
- `tags` (List of String) List of tags of the node.
- `x` (Number) X coordinate on the topology canvas.
- `y` (Number) Y coordinate on the topology canvas.

### Read-Only

- `compute_id` (String) ID of a compute this node is on, a UUID4.
- `id` (String) Node ID (UUID).
- `interfaces` (Attributes List) List of interfaces on the node. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--interfaces))
- `serial_devices` (List of Object) List of serial devices (consoles). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--serial_devices))
- `state` (String) Node state (`DEFINED_ON_CORE`, `STOPPED`, `STARTED`, `BOOTED`).
- `vnc_key` (String) VNC key of console, a UUID4.

- `ip4` (List of String) IPv4 address list.
- `ip6` (List of String) IPv6 address list.
- `is_connected` (Boolean) Is the interface connected to a link?
- `label` (String) Interface label.
- `mac_address` (String) MAC address.
- `state` (String) interface state (`UP` or `DOWN`).
